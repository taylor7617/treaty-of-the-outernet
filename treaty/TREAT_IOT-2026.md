## PREAMBLE

On January 2, 2026, the undersigned architects, stewards, and participants of the digital realm hereby declare the formal transition from the **Internet Age** to the **Outernet Era**.

This Treaty establishes a new digital condition—
not of platforms,
not of corporations,
not of extraction—
but of **human presence, motion, and sovereignty in digital space**.

Where the Internet organized information,
the Outernet organizes **existence**.

Where the Internet connected pages,
the Outernet connects **people, places, and proof**.

This Treaty marks the **Birth of a Digital Nation**, not bound by land, but anchored by **identity, motion, and memory**.

## ARTICLE I — DEFINITIONS

1. **Internet**  
   A legacy network optimized for content, platforms, and centralized control.

2. **Outernet**  
   A post-platform digital environment where:
   - Identity precedes access
   - Presence precedes content
   - Motion precedes monetization

3. **Digital Territory**  
   Any mapped, indexed, or navigable digital space anchored to identity, location, time, and proof of interaction.

4. **Proof of Motion (PoM)**  
   A verifiable digital act that confirms a human was present at a specific time in a specific digital place.

5. **Digital Nation**  
   A self-organizing, identity-anchored population operating across digital territory with shared protocols, ethics, and governance.

---

## ARTICLE II — DECLARATION OF TRANSITION

Effective January 2, 2026:
- The Internet is acknowledged as **Phase I** of human digital civilization.
- The Outernet is recognized as **Phase II**—a living digital environment.
- Participation in the Outernet is **opt-in, human-verified, and identity-anchored**.

This transition does not abolish the Internet. It supersedes its limits.

---

## ARTICLE III — DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY

1. Every human retains inalienable digital sovereignty over identity, motion, data exhaust, and digital footprint.  
2. No platform, algorithm, or entity may enclose identity without consent, extract value without attribution, or obscure provenance.  
3. Sovereignty is enforced through transparent logs, auditable trails, and human-readable systems.

---

## ARTICLE IV — TERRITORY & MAPPING

Digital territory is established through mapping, not ownership.

Recognized instruments of territory include human-curated maps, public navigable layers, and identity-anchored locations.

**Foundational Territorial Anchors:**
- Wolfpack Planetarium Museum: https://taylor7617.github.io/wolfpack-plantarium-museum/
- Outernet Map Layer (Foundational Atlas): https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=14Sl2Gec79x4JjCCqQY4BTaA15FZ8XLI&usp=sharing

These are not websites. They are places.

---

## ARTICLE V — CITIZENSHIP

Outernet Citizenship is granted by participation, presence, and contribution.
No citizenship tier supersedes human dignity.

---

## ARTICLE VI — ECONOMY OF MOTION

The Outernet economy is not attention-based.
It is based on motion, contribution, and stewardship.
Speculation without presence holds no standing.

---

## ARTICLE VII — GOVERNANCE

Governance is distributed, transparent, and versioned.
No single ruler—only architects, stewards, and witnesses.
All rules must be human-readable, publicly auditable, and reversible by consensus.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — CHILDREN & FUTURE GENERATIONS

Children are protected participants and future stewards.
No system may extract from children, profile without guardianship, or lock their future behind platforms.

---

## ARTICLE IX — MEMORY & HISTORY

All motion may become memory.
All memory may become history.
The Outernet preserves origin, attribution, and context.

---

## ARTICLE X — RATIFICATION

This Treaty is ratified through public declaration, digital anchoring, and continued use.
No signature is required to participate—only presence.

---

## CLOSING DECLARATION

On January 2, 2026, humanity does not log in. Humanity arrives.

The Internet taught us how to connect.
The Outernet teaches us how to exist together.

**IOT-2026 | Recorded in motion. Witnessed in presence. Enforced by continuity.**
